Added the project file and the source code

2023-11-30 - Nicolas Berube
- Started working on the project
- Realised that the work is needed in the project folder (files given by prof)

createplan.c 
- should be finished

execnodes.h 
- Started the beggining and went to continue other files
- Realised I cant continue NodeHashJoin withouth completing this first
- Finished the file, hopefully it should now be complete. other changes might be required if there are missing hj_... for the nodeHashJoin.c

nodeHash.c
- Copied the MultiExecHash into the ExecHash, other changes might be needed (is it normal that it reutrns null everytime?) (Marked by "TODO:"
- Changed the hashtable->growEnabled from true to false (marked by "FIXME:")
- ExecScanHashBucket might need changes (none done by me and marked by "TODO:")

NodeHashJoin.c 
- should the HashNode be hashState or PlanState? (Marked by "FIXME") -> later decided to use hashState because of innerNode= (hashState*)
- added TupleTableSlot *outtuple; (marked by "FINISHED:")
- Cant continue because im missing stuff from header file
- Added a TODO: marking where I left off (line 79)

nodeHash.c
- Updates to ExecScanHashJoin to incorporate inner and outer, all changes should have comments
- There are a few FIXMEs where I'm worried about something not working

??? - ???
Insert your comments here on what you did
